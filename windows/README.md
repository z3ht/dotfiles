# Windows Configuration

Most of the configurations in here must be manually configured. However, the Windows experience is 100x less frustrating with a properly configured system.

### Essential Programs

Window Manager: Workspacer  
Terminal: Alacritty + WSL (either 1.0 for faster file reads or 2.0 for smoother experience)  
Hotkeys: Windows Desktop shortcuts + Power Toys  
System Search: Power Toys
